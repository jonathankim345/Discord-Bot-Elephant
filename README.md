# Discord-Bot-Elephant
This was my first coding project, a simple Discord bot that would react to user input in the form of a message with certain keywords.

Messages that would include words like "sad", "depressed", "unhappy", "angry", "miserable", "depressing", or "afraid" would trigger the bot, that would then send a request to a API to fetch an inspirational quote, which the bot would then parse and finally display in the form of a message sent on Discord, a popular messaging app.

The motivation for this project was to help my friends remain motivated and optimistic with the collective fear and anxiety of the pandemic. Especially as more activities trended to online settings, the online space became an important area to connect.

The naming of the bot as Elephant is because the choice of imagery and naming of the online bot was for a prized stuffed animal of mine.
